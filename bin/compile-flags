**	Flags that control compilation for various machine
**	architectures, manufacturers, and OS versions

Flag Name	Meaning/Usage
_________	________________________________________________________
BYTESWAP	Used when compiling for a hardware architecture that has
		byte-swapped words and word-swapped 32-bit cells, e.g. 80386.
OS4		True if compiling for SunOS 4.x

NOPIXRECT	Used to suppress pixrect/pixwin options when they're not
		needed or not available.  True if XWINDOW is.

AIX		True if compiling for AIX
sparc		True if we're compiling on a SPARC machine.

NOASM		If true, suppress any attempt to include assembler
		versions of things in the emulator.  In 'lispemul.c',
		if this is true, disables:
			OPDISP
			PROFILE
C_ONLY

OPDISP		Use "fast-opcode-dispatch" macros




--Debugging/Tracing/Check-enabling flags--

DEBUG		Used when debugging, to enclose trace and dump code.
		Best usage is with DBPRINT((controlString, args*));, which
		calls printf, and compiles only if DEBUG is true.  See
		dbprint.h for the definition.
TRACE
TRACE2
OPTRACE		If true, the dispatch loop prints the PC & opcode each time thru
FNTRACE		If true, you see the name of each function called.
STACKCHECK	If true, you see unusual cases of stack manipulation
		traced.  E.g., the hard cases of RETURN, like non-contiguous
		stack frames, get mentioned.
LISPTRACE	True if you want to see LISP calls & returns traced to
		stdout; Generally, for traces of lisp-level events.
PROFILE		If true, the profiling control code is enabled.  You must
		also change the optflags to contain -p or -pg, to use prof
		or gprof, respectively.
CHECK
FSBCHECK	If true, you see a trace of large free stack blocks when
		the stack is manipulated; was used for debugging stack code.

WINDOW
INIT		Used when compiling an emulator to build a loadup.  Use it
		to dike out code that deals with network initialization, e.g.

MYOPTRACE	Used to check the stack's validity on each opcode execution.
		Requires NOASM

PCTRACE		When true, compiles in a 100-long ring buffer that holds the
		last 100 PCs, Function-blocks, and Opcodes executed. "pccounter"
		is the offset where the next one will go.  Also requires NOASM.
		The 3 tables are called pc_table, fn_table, and op_table.




--Flags that control new features, features under test, etc.--

DISPLAYBUFFER	10/3/89 JDS -- enables the experimental code for copying
		changed portions of the display bank to the frame buffer.
		Meant for supporting mono mode on a CG6 with no single-bit
		bitplane. 1/22/91 JDS:  This is now the standard flag for
		compiling for color displays.
WINDOW
FLIPCURSOR	If true, the "sandbar" line in the cursor will get flipped
		by the C stack-frame-moving code, just as it does on a D
		machine.  Otherwise, you don't see it.
ORG_FILPCORSORBAR If true, you get the pixwin version of cursor changing;
		otherwise, it gets done by direct writes into the display
		region.
OLD_CURSOR	If true, uses the pixwin cursor code (e.g., win_setcursor);
		otherwise, uses the direct-write technique. This is only needed
		for SUNDISPLAY.
OS4_TYPE4BUG	If true, includes the patches around SunOS 4.0.x's failure
		to tell you you've got a Type-4 keyboard.
ALLDIRSEARCH	CURRENTLY HARD DISABLED IN directory.c; looks like it 
		controlled recursive directory searches??
KBINT		If true (it looks like??), the emulator does most of the KBD
		transition processing in C, rather than interrupting LISP for
		it, and the transition interrupts happen when the OS signals
		a transition, rather than by polling?
RS232INT	If true, the RS232 device (NOT USED, a translation of Lisp's
		code), uses the interrupt signalling support of timer.c to
		know when to read characters.  NOT USED, probably obsolete.
TTYINT		Analogous to RS232INT, for the translated TTY device.
ETHERINT
COLOR		If TRUE, supports 8bits-per-pixel color on CG4 and CG6 frame
		buffer of Sun work station. IF COLOR is TRUE, don't use OLD_CURSOR 
		flag.
CATCH		If true, includes some CATCH C code, for finding the blip,
		finding variable names and PVAR names in frames.  As of 10/2/89
		this code is unused, and is called nowhere else in the system.
RECLAIMINC	If true, then the RECLAIMCELL opcode calls gcreclaimcell in
		C; otherwise it punts.  As of 10/3/89, this was never debugged
		and is not in any system.  Probably fairly easy to debug??
KB_SUN4		The kbd type for the Type-4 keyboard.  Defined only because
		older OS versions of the compiler don't define it automatically.
FLTINT		If true, use the floating-point exception interrupts to detect
		errors and overflows on FP operations.  The interrupt sets a
		global error flag.  Otherwise, calls library routines to see
		the condition code from each operation.  For SPARCs, it's not
		clear that the interrupt trick works, because of code re-
		arrangement by the C compiler.

XWINDOW		True if compiling for an X-windows emulator.

BIGATOMS	True if this emulator will support 3-byte symbols, instead of
		the old, 2-byte atom numbers.

NEWBITBLT	True if we want to use assembler BITBLT code, rather than
		have code created inline by macro calls.
